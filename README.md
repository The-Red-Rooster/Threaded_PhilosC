# Threaded_PhilosC
An expansion of the Dining Philosophers program, this time using threads instead of system calls.

This repository includes a zip file of the entire program as well as loose files that can be viewable on-site. This was an assignment in the Systems Programming class CS360 at WSU, 2020.
